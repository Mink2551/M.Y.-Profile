My 2 main responsibilities included making sportsperson cards, among other tasks.",
    PassagesBody32: "On days 2 through 6 of the Satit Sampan Sports Event, I took on the challenging task of photo selection and editing using the Lightroom program. This work was particularly demanding as I had to handle over 3000 pictures per day within a tight timeframe, typically from 11:00 PM to 12:00 PM the next day. With only one day to clear my sportsperson card work, which involved a large number of individuals, the workload felt overwhelming. On the first day, I found myself sleeping as late as 1:00 AM and needing to wake up at 7:00 AM to continue the demanding schedule.",
    PassagesBody33: "As day 2 of the event began, I spent the day relaxing, anticipating the arrival of the photos at 17:00. However, to my dismay, the photos were delayed, arriving at 19:00 instead. This delay left all of the photographers feeling exhausted and frustrated. Witnessing their fatigue weighed heavily on me, but the work needed to continue. Despite the setback, I pushed forward with the task at hand. Recognizing the urgency, I promptly sent a portion of the photos to the Bangkok team, (the technical department was unable to attend the event in person.) This effort helped alleviate some of the workload, with the Bangkok team handling approximately 20% of the tasks remotely.",
    PassagesBody34: "After completing my work until 3:00 AM, I finally finished editing the 2,400+ photos. Exhausted, I went to sleep, waking up later than usual at 9:00 AM due to fatigue. By 11:30 AM, I learned that the Bangkok team had not yet completed their portion of the work. Recognizing the urgency, I stepped in to assist, tackling another 10% of the workload they hadn't finished. Once the task was completed, I uploaded the finalized work to the SC page just in time for the 12:00 PM deadline. This routine persisted for the remaining five days of the event, with the number of photos increasing each day, ranging from 3000+ to 4000+.",
